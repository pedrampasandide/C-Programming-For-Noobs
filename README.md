**Author**: Pedram Pasandide  

## About the Book  
This repository contains the eBook version of my lecture notes, *C Programming For Noobs*. After over a year of teaching courses related to programming in C at McMaster University, I decided to compile my lecture notes into this textbook, hoping it can help students and readers learn C more easily. The textbook is available for free to the community for personal and educational use.
